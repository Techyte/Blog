			 <p>Was going to write a thing on how simplistic the left and right polotical spectrum is but I honestly don’t know enough and couldn’t do it justice. If your interested there are plenty of YouTube videos and articles going into it but at least for now I’ll stick to history and Ideology. Anyway I’d like to let you know that I’m working on a small thing on world wars but sadly I can’t.</p>

			 <p>THIS IS NOT AN ENDORSEMENT OF ANY IDEOLOGIES TALKED ABOUT IT IS MERELY A DISSCUSION ON THEM!</p>
<p>Was thinking about this today, during WW2 the axis powers were not just refered to as all facist, you obviously had facist Italy and the other two definitely fell under thr umbrella of ‘facist’ but instead they are refered to as ‘Nazi Germany’ and ‘Imperial Japan’. I think this is interesting because it shows the slightly differing ideology between each nation. Facist Italy was just that, facist, incredibly militaristic and nationalistic but nothing really special other than wanting to re-establish the roman empire.</p>
<p>Then you have Nazi Germany who were driven by, you guesed it, Nazisim. This was basically Hitlers brand of facisim that focused on not only driving Germans forward but everyone else out. Finally you have Imperial Japan which I think is the most interesting, they were undoubtedly facist (millitaristic and nationalistic) but their conquest and motivation for war was much more focused on building an empire rather than just because they were facist, sure they (at least the leadership) thought they had a divine right to win and subjugate the rest of the world but that was more justification rather than motivation, the motivation was Imperialism.</p>
<p>And I think thats the key point about these names, they represent each nations individual motivation, justification and overall just the driving factor behind each of their desire for war. They all had their own brand of facisim. Anyway I thought this was interesting and worth writing something about it.</p>

			 <p>So to follow up on yesterdays post I learned some more about Australian republicanism and Australian government in general. First of all is that the defeat of the voice to parliament basically means that if a republic referendum was held right after and failed it would be a huge blow, 2 back to back rejections does not look good. I also found out that Australian Prime Ministers have no term limits like thr U.S does (also the U.S’s term limits only come from an ammendment, the 10th I believe). Just some random interesting facts to prove that learning dosent happen all at once and even small things can take days to begin to learn about. (im trying to add messages and morals to the end if these and i dont know if i hate or despise it) anyway thanks for reasint.</p>

			 <p>ALR so I just went down a rabbit hole on Australian politics, constitution and monarchy vs republic. There was actually a referendum on whether to become a republic in 1999 but it failed, mostly because of the model of republic that was presented (the president would be chosen by parliament rather than by popular vote). After the queens death albanese stated that, out of respect, he would not push a republic referendum until at least his second term if it occurs. So it is entirely possible that in the next few years we will have a referendum on it. The only thing it would actually do is signify that Australia is no longer tied, in any way to the UK and we are fully independent. The president probably wouldn’t have any real power but be more of a person that is supposed to personify the nation and act as a diplomat. Personally I am 100% in favour of a republic and monarchys just seem like a relic from the past. Either way there was a lot more to this discussion than I thought there would be (as with all things) and I hope you found this interesting.</p>

			 <p>So my current obsession is this YouTube channel called “the closer look”. The guy that runs it does video essays on movies and screenwriting, breaking down why specific things work and why other things don’t. One of my favourite ones that I have watched so far is his video on why the messages in Avatar just don’t hit the spot/work well. He also has a video on Wonder Woman 1984 that I found really interesting. I’ve always wanted to write something and this channel has given me some motivation, idk where it will go but my hopes are high. It’s a wonderful channel if your looking for writing advice and/or lessons and I wholeheartedly recommend you check it out!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As I’ve been reading more and more short stories and light novels I’ve noticed that the writing style always follows a similar pattern. It starts off really descriptive and detailed as the Author tries to prove that they can write like that and this isn’t going to be like any other story, it’s going to be detailed! The one caveat of this is that it often feels forced and a bit ostentatious. After a few paragrpahs, the Author seems to notice (or is forced to because of) that this style of writing is just not sustainable for them (and they do it poorly at that) and it eventually settles down into the real quality of the their writing. I think this is interesting because of how often I see it and how a few weeks ago before I noticed this it would be the exact kind of mistake that I would make. All it does is make you seem less competent, for example stories that don’t do this and kick off with the same style and quality feel so much better and interesting to read from the get go (this is also partly due to the fact that because they are not focusing on fancy writing they can actually write better and more engaging scenes). Anyway I found this funny and is one of an endless number of things that circles through my head daily.</p>

			 <p><em>plays spiderverse music</em> Lets do this again…</p>
<p>holla. Watched Napolean today. REALLY good at the start especially with the siege of toulon. It gets iffy after his corronation and theres this really long hit about him trying to get an heir that could have been spent on his Russian Campaign or any of the other battles. The 3rd act is really fast and obviously needed more time. They skip over basically everything after his kid (with the exception of the battle of Waterloo) and his later life is just not done justice. It feels to me like it was intended to be a 3.5-4 hour movie but they were forced to cut it down to show in theaters. One thing that I think was done well but still could have done with more time was the Battle of Waterloo, it didn’t really talk about how important it was and if you haden’t heard about it before it was kinda out of the blue but I really liked it as a battle scene. Theres one bit where the English all form squares and shoot down thre circling French cavalry that for some reason I just LOVED (but also hated because the French were litterally just going in circles like wtf do something lol). Anyway it was a very accurate movie, looked and sounded as I would expect from this kind of movie and all it needed is a longer runtime to become one of the best movies of the year. Oh also before I forget the acting was amazing, especially Pheonix just captured everything about Napolean perfectly.</p>

			 <p>TIL: Due to Taiwans obviously bullshit claim to the entirety of China, they also have to technically lay claim to mongolia, small parts of Russia and parts of half a dozen or so countries that border China. This is because the area they lay claim to actually originates from the previous Qing dynasty that both the ROC (Taiwan) and PRC (Mainland China) claim to be the successor to. Despite this Taiwan maintains not insignificant relations with mongolia and its all a big web of bureaucracy woven by Taiwan to not piss of China.</p>

Either way it was really good and because it was so comprehensive it went over some stuff that most things skip over, like the details of the North African battles.</p>

			 <p>TIL: After the collapse is the Soviet Union, the British prime minister and French president were opposed to German reunification. They ‘feared’ that Germany would revert back to its imperial tendency’s and try to reclaim territory lost in WW2. This meant that in order to appease them, the new Germany had to agree to all of these treaties and amendments that basically set its borders in the most binding way possible. This still holds up today and I think it’s a really good example to show that the allies weren’t wholly good even after the war.</p>

			 <p>TIL: Your body produces something like 7 billion red blood cells per hour! And they live on average for 150 days, your body is basically peformijg a miricle to keep you alive. I also found out that your poop is mostly dead red blood cells, hence why its brown. Red blood cells are cupped in order to retain oxygen better which I find interesting and led to me finding out that each blood cell carries hundereds of o2 molecules each. Also ~90% of the cells in your body are just bacteria that you need to survive. 
One final thing I learned is that your body can’t get rid of heavy metals like iron and mercury. This means that you only need to take say Iron supliments for a small amount of time before you are good. It also means that there are some things around you needing to pay attention to any fish you eat because it will have eaten many smaller fish which will have eaten more smaller fish which all ends up with all the MERCURY in ALL those fish getting delivered right to you when you eat it.</p>
<p>This was just an info dump of some of the highlights of a really interesting class I had with a really good teacher of mine.

			 <p>Alright so I&rsquo;ve done some more research on how influential the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were to Japans surrender.</p>
<p>The general consensus is that the war was going badly and the bomb was, to the Japanese leadership, really no different than a regular bombing. They were already planning on surrendering due to the impending invasion by the U.S and USSR. The bomb simply provided an easy excuse that they could point to, in order to cover up the fact that they were already loosing the war.</p>
<p>It meant that they could preserve the &lsquo;perfect emperor&rsquo; façade because it wouldn&rsquo;t have been his fault, it was the allies that had suddenly created this magical bomb that forced the Japanese to surrender! Basically they were power hungry dictators.</p>
<p>So I was wrong about not believing that the Japanese leadership saw the bombings as &lsquo;just another&rsquo; bombing. They were willing to keep being bombed if it meant preserving their power and pride.</p>
<p>TLDR; The war was going badly and the bombings were a good excuse for Japanese leadership to ignore their failures during the war.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>While researching U.S military spending I came across an article arguing that the common narrative that Japan only surrendered because of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is not entirely accurate.</p>
<p><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/">Article Link</a></p>
<p>It has some interesting points but it mainly boils down to 2 main things (I’ll explain them and then give my opinion).</p>
<p>The first thing they mention is how it happened at a time where every other day, a Japanese city was being bombed. This caused Japan to see the nuking on Hiroshima (and 3 days later Nagasaki) as more or less just an upgraded and slightly more powerful attack, and therefore weren’t going to surrender just because something that was already going on had slightly changed.</p>
<p>The second reason is the Soviet Unions plans to invade Japan from the north, combined with Britain and the U.S’s invasion from the south was looking to be increasingly devastating for Japan. The USSR has only recently declared war on Japan and had already proven that they could easily sweep into and take critical Japanese city’s. For Japan, a joint Allied invasion from the north and south was un-winnable.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that people see the bombings as the final stroke is because the Japanese surrender came 6 days after the bombings and it seems easy to connect to two. Something the article points out though is that the full report on the Hiroshima bombing didn’t reach the Japanese leadership until the day after they surrendered.</p>
<p>It then goes on to explain the reasoning for each countries pushing the idea of the nukes being the deciding factor.</p>
<p>OPINION PART THAT I WILL PROBABLY REGRET ONE DAY STARTS HERE:</p>
<p>I think the bombings did have an impact on the surrender. The article talks about the statistics of how much each bombing destroyed of each respective city but I think this is a bit misleading. If you look at how many people died in the Hiroshima bombings and compare that to the other, standard bombings, the nuclear bomb did far more actual damage.</p>
<p>I also think implying that the report not getting to the leadership until after they surrendered meaning that they had no idea that it happened is a bit weird. They would definitely had gotten some reports if a city was destroyed, even if it was a common occurrence.</p>
<p>I do agree however that it wasn&rsquo;t as big a part of the decision as most people make it out to be. It  was certainly a part of why the surrendered, but the impending invasion by England, the U.S, and most importantly the Soviets would have been the main reasoning.</p>
<p>I would like to state that I have no credentials to be making these opinions but this is my blog and I make the rules ‘round here.</p>
<p>I recommend you read the article and I will probably read more on the topic and might write another small opinion piece on it when I’m more informed.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

			 <p>A few days ago I watched a really interesting and eye-opening video by Think That Through (T3) on Kurzgesagt - In a nutshell. It was on Kurzgesagt&rsquo;s climate videos and how they provide a very narrow and specific way of thinking about climate change and how to solve it.</p>
<p>Video link: <a href="https://youtu.be/uCuy1DaQzWI">Kurzgesagt and the art of climate greenwashing</a></p>
<p>I started writing a few paragraphs summarizing the video but released that I would have to either omit a lot of interesting and crucial information or just do a bad job of expressing everything that they did. I might write another blog post just summarizing it for myself later, but in the meantime just go watch the video. Its really interesting and only talks about the things that T3 have a problem with. It isn&rsquo;t one of those doom and gloom videos trying to get views by making out there claims. They have real and well thought out arguments and if you take the time to watch it I think its well worth the hour and a half.</p>
<p>TLDR; cannot express how much you should watch this video. <strong>GO WATCH IT!!</strong>.</p>

			 <p>Been researching why the U.S.A has such a large military nowadays. It&rsquo;s actually really interesting, it covers topics like geography and the philosophy of the U.S. I am in no way qualified to write anything definitive but I&rsquo;m writing a summary that I might put on here. I&rsquo;ll be like a timeline/ideological/geographical rundown of all the reasons behind the seemingly excessive U.S military spending.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am 15 years old and have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing. This will more be like what I&rsquo;ve learnt rather than an informative piece.</p>
