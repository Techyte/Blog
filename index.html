			 <p>TIL: Despite Berlin sitting inside of East Germany, during the cold war, the U.S, Britain and France all held areas in Berlin, seperate from their areas in West Germany. Suppose I should have thought of that sooner considering I hear the term east and west berlin just as often but I guess I always though they meant their country counterparts. Also it was called the Berlin wall lol, no idea how I missed this but you learn a new thing everyday.</p>
<p>P.S: Instead of writing a whole blog post every day I think I might try just writing something that I learnt every day and putting it on here. If I find something interesting I’ll still write about it though.
Also it has been brought to my attention that I don’t know how to write TL;DR. I will be correcting this mistake from now on.</p>

			 <p>Alright so I&rsquo;ve done some more research on how influential the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were to Japans surrender.</p>
<p>The general consensus is that the war was going badly and the bomb was, to the Japanese leadership, really no different than a regular bombing. They were already planning on surrendering due to the impending invasion by the U.S and USSR. The bomb simply provided an easy excuse that they could point to, in order to cover up the fact that they were already loosing the war.</p>
<p>It meant that they could preserve the &lsquo;perfect emperor&rsquo; façade because it wouldn&rsquo;t have been his fault, it was the allies that had suddenly created this magical bomb that forced the Japanese to surrender! Basically they were power hungry dictators.</p>
<p>So I was wrong about not believing that the Japanese leadership saw the bombings as &lsquo;just another&rsquo; bombing. They were willing to keep being bombed if it meant preserving their power and pride.</p>
<p>TLDR; The war was going badly and the bombings were a good excuse for Japanese leadership to ignore their failures during the war.</p>

			 <p>While researching U.S military spending I came across an article arguing that the common narrative that Japan only surrendered because of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is not entirely accurate.</p>
<p><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/">Article Link</a></p>
<p>It has some interesting points but it mainly boils down to 2 main things (I’ll explain them and then give my opinion).</p>
<p>The first thing they mention is how it happened at a time where every other day, a Japanese city was being bombed. This caused Japan to see the nuking on Hiroshima (and 3 days later Nagasaki) as more or less just an upgraded and slightly more powerful attack, and therefore weren’t going to surrender just because something that was already going on had slightly changed.</p>
<p>The second reason is the Soviet Unions plans to invade Japan from the north, combined with Britain and the U.S’s invasion from the south was looking to be increasingly devastating for Japan. The USSR has only recently declared war on Japan and had already proven that they could easily sweep into and take critical Japanese city’s. For Japan, a joint Allied invasion from the north and south was un-winnable.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that people see the bombings as the final stroke is because the Japanese surrender came 6 days after the bombings and it seems easy to connect to two. Something the article points out though is that the full report on the Hiroshima bombing didn’t reach the Japanese leadership until the day after they surrendered.</p>
<p>It then goes on to explain the reasoning for each countries pushing the idea of the nukes being the deciding factor.</p>
<p>OPINION PART THAT I WILL PROBABLY REGRET ONE DAY STARTS HERE:</p>
<p>I think the bombings did have an impact on the surrender. The article talks about the statistics of how much each bombing destroyed of each respective city but I think this is a bit misleading. If you look at how many people died in the Hiroshima bombings and compare that to the other, standard bombings, the nuclear bomb did far more actual damage.</p>
<p>I also think implying that the report not getting to the leadership until after they surrendered meaning that they had no idea that it happened is a bit weird. They would definitely had gotten some reports if a city was destroyed, even if it was a common occurrence.</p>
<p>I do agree however that it wasn&rsquo;t as big a part of the decision as most people make it out to be. It  was certainly a part of why the surrendered, but the impending invasion by England, the U.S, and most importantly the Soviets would have been the main reasoning.</p>
<p>I would like to state that I have no credentials to be making these opinions but this is my blog and I make the rules ‘round here.</p>
<p>I recommend you read the article and I will probably read more on the topic and might write another small opinion piece on it when I’m more informed.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

			 <p>A few days ago I watched a really interesting and eye-opening video by Think That Through (T3) on Kurzgesagt - In a nutshell. It was on Kurzgesagt&rsquo;s climate videos and how they provide a very narrow and specific way of thinking about climate change and how to solve it.</p>
<p>Video link: <a href="https://youtu.be/uCuy1DaQzWI">Kurzgesagt and the art of climate greenwashing</a></p>
<p>I started writing a few paragraphs summarizing the video but released that I would have to either omit a lot of interesting and crucial information or just do a bad job of expressing everything that they did. I might write another blog post just summarizing it for myself later, but in the meantime just go watch the video. Its really interesting and only talks about the things that T3 have a problem with. It isn&rsquo;t one of those doom and gloom videos trying to get views by making out there claims. They have real and well thought out arguments and if you take the time to watch it I think its well worth the hour and a half.</p>
<p>TLDR; cannot express how much you should watch this video. <strong>GO WATCH IT!!</strong>.</p>

			 <p>Been researching why the U.S.A has such a large military nowadays. It&rsquo;s actually really interesting, it covers topics like geography and the philosophy of the U.S. I am in no way qualified to write anything definitive but I&rsquo;m writing a summary that I might put on here. I&rsquo;ll be like a timeline/ideological/geographical rundown of all the reasons behind the seemingly excessive U.S military spending.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am 15 years old and have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing. This will more be like what I&rsquo;ve learnt rather than an informative piece.</p>
