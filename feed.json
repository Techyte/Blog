I also found out that your poop is mostly dead red blood cells, hence why its brown. Red blood cells are cupped in order to retain oxygen better which I find interesting and led to me finding out that each blood cell carries hundereds of o2 molecules each. Also ~90% of the cells in your body are just bacteria that you need to survive. \nOne final thing I learned is that your body can’t get rid of heavy metals like iron and mercury. This means that you only need to take say Iron supliments for a small amount of time before you are good. It also means that there are some things around you needing to pay attention to any fish you eat because it will have eaten many smaller fish which will have eaten more smaller fish which all ends up with all the MERCURY in ALL those fish getting delivered right to you when you eat it.</p>\n<p>This was just an info dump of some of the highlights of a really interesting class I had with a really good teacher of mine. It was all tangents and only slightly related to the actual topic (blood splatter) but it was absolutely amazing and goes to show that if both teachers and students care, stuff can actually turn out well.</p>\n",
