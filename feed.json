				"content_html": "<p>Been thinking about the discrepancy between the United States campaign season vs most other western democracy’s. The us campaigns last for months and months, candidates spending literally billions on pushing themselves forward. This is in contrast to most of the rest of the world where “election season” really only lasts a few weeks. You going about your life and then it’s like “oh ok I guess there is an election in a few weeks”. The only indicator are maybe some signs around that advertise a candidate.</p>\n<p>One potential reason for this could be the age of US elections. Over time they may have simply gotten longer because people realised that if you campaign for longer you’re more likely to get more votes. This makes sense because US democracy is arguably one of not the oldest surviving democracy in the world. On the other hand though, if that were the case then burgeoning democracy’s should have really short campaign times compared to established ones. But this doesn’t hold up either, with places like Spain and Latin American nations current democratic systems being younger than say, France or the UK and yet still having similar campaign lengths. No. I think the problem, if we call it that, is more subtle.</p>\n<p>Part of the reason I believe that us election cycles last so much longer than others, is because of the timing of an election. The US is very unique in that presidential elections are held at predictable, consistent times, every 4 years, in November. This means that candidates can time everything out years in advance, planning to the minute when and where parts of the campaign will occur. In contrast, Australia for example, does have a maximum term length, but the prime minister can just call an election whenever they want, leading to unpredictability in the election timing. This means campaigns will hold out until they know when it will occur to begin, which usually only leaves them a few weeks. The reason they wait is because they don’t want to start to early or to late, to late and they give their opponents a leg up, and they don’t want to start early because of the other half of this coin.</p>\n<p>In most major democracy’s across the globe, campaign spending is heavily regulated, every cent, dollar, pound or euro that is spent is recorded and monitored, candidates are required to stay within a certain limit, in order to prevent, well, a situation like what is the case in the US. Yet again, America is unique in that there are basically no limits on the amount of money candidates can spend, sure the people who run the election need to know what campaigns are spending their money on, but they don’t limit it. This is the reason I believe US elections are so bloated, drawn out and just take forever. Candidates can spend as much money as they want meaning they don’t have to conserve resources the way other candidates in other democracy’s do, they just gogogo from the moment they can with nothing to stop them.</p>\n<p>US elections aren’t longer because the US candidates are smarter than the rest of the world, they are longer, because they can be.</p>\n<p>tried something a bit different here, in my head it sorta plays out like a mystery crime thing, not sure it comes across as that tho, anyway I hope you found this interesting and/or laughed because I got something wrong, either way.

The US is very unique in that presidential elections are held at predictable, consistent times, every 4 years, in November. This means that candidates can time everything out years in advance, planning to the minute when and where parts of the campaign will occur. In contrast, Australia for example, does have a maximum term length, but the prime minister can just call an election whenever they want, leading to unpredictability in the election timing. This means campaigns will hold out until they know when it will occur to begin, which usually only leaves them a few weeks. The reason they wait is because they don’t want to start to early or to late, to late and they give their opponents a leg up, and they don’t want to start early because of the other half of this coin.\r\n\r\nIn most major democracy’s across the globe, campaign spending is heavily regulated, every cent, dollar, pound or euro that is spent is recorded and monitored, candidates are required to stay within a certain limit, in order to prevent, well, a situation like what is the case in the US. Yet again, America is unique in that there are basically no limits on the amount of money candidates can spend, sure the people who run the election need to know what campaigns are spending their money on, but they don’t limit it. This is the reason I believe US elections are so bloated, drawn out and just take forever. Candidates can spend as much money as they want meaning they don’t have to conserve resources the way other candidates in other democracy’s do, they just gogogo from the moment they can with nothing to stop them.\r\n\r\nUS elections aren’t longer because the US candidates are smarter than the rest of the world, they are longer, because they can be.\r\n\r\ntried something a bit different here, in my head it sorta plays out like a mystery crime thing, not sure it comes across as that tho, anyway I hope you found this interesting and/or laughed because I got something wrong, either way.

				"content_html": "<p>So my latest hobby for the past week or so has been a grand strategy world war 2 game, hearts of iron 4 (or hoi4 if you don’t have much time). I actually bought the game ages ago cause a friend of mine had it and it looked interesting, but because it’s such a complicated mess of systems and I was overwhelmed I really only sat down and learnt how to play recently. And boy howdy have I learnt how to play (pretty poorly but we will get to that).</p>\n<p>(For a bit of background in the game you pick a country and you start playing as that country, waging wars, building industry, changing the government and so on. It starts you off in 1939, and because I generally have the ‘historical focuses’ option ticked, other countries will follow what they did in real life at that time)\nThe tutorial for the game is what I started off with. It makes you pick Italy because they start off at war with Ethiopia so it gives you a chance to learn the ropes and such. Long story short, it took me 3 restarts and many desperate last stands before I finally got a hang of the combat and managed to defeat and conquer of all Abyssinia. Wasn’t a great start but I had a good grasp of the game by that point. Anyway, in my infinite wisdom (and presumably the high that came from actually winning a war) my next goal was war with Germany. This ended as you might have expected, I was overrun in a matter of months and a civil war started.</p>\n<p>After that stunning performance I decided to take it a bit more slowly and tried focusing a bit more on the conquering land through the games focus trees, diplomacy and decisions mechanics. This led to me to guaranteeing Austrias independence (I think I was a bit salty about the last run) to try and contain German expansion, this once again, went basically the way you would expect, Germany tried to take over, I tried to stop them, I failed. But by this point I had actually learnt a bit about combat and was doing reasonably well in defending my territory (the Germans were still advancing mind you, just slower than they otherwise would have). It probably also helped that I had managed to secure the annexation of Albania and was puppeting Yugoslavia. Either way, that run ended the same way as the last, civil war, giving up, starting over.</p>\n<p>After my failed attempts at running Italy I decided to try my hand at the night USSR! With a stunning industrial base and a virtually unlimited supply of troops the soviets are apparently a really good beginner country to play. In my run I tried to follow the advice of people online, I built up my factories and developed my industry ahead of the upcoming conflicts. My mistake was trying to do to many things at once, I was trying to conquer the Baltic countries, go to war with Finland, and preemptively invade Germany, all at the same time. In the end, I got bogged down in Finland for longer than I needed to, foolishly denying a peace offer, thinking I could afford to take the rest of the country, and then when Germany invaded, I had no real plan as to how to counter it and eventually just gave up. Either way, not an amazing run but I learnt never to say no to a peace offer.</p>\n<p>Now we get to my current run, Australia! Immediately after starting I realised that Australia didn’t have much in the way of infrastructure and factories, meaning it would be harder for me to wage war and such. I am doing my best to rectify this by just building as much as I can, developing until I can create a decent base to work on. In the meantime I started steering towards communism! Joining the Comintern and turning New Zealand into my puppet. This eventually led to a civil war, which, because of how large and empty the place is, is a real peace of cake, just kinda walk in and claim back the land. The problem arose when New Zealand joined the opposit side, dragging out the war. I ended up attempting an invasion of the southern island but I haven’t done naval invasions in the game before and ended up losing all my divisions lol.</p>\n<p>And that’s pretty much where I’m at rn, I’m having a blast learning how to play and all I can hope is that it doesn’t fill my mind with alternate history that I will mix up with the real stuff :p</p>\n",

Not once does the once-ler look at the destruction he can caused, <em>as</em> it is happening. Sure he looks at it afterwards with a devistated and grief stricken face to show how sorry he is, but not once does the movie give the once-ler agency. Not once is the once-ler responsible or aware of the damge he is causing. This is in stark contrast to say, the antagonist of the movie, the overly comical, red herring of a villan, O’Hare. This guy is so over the top its hillarious. And thats by design, O’Hare is what the movie “<em>tries to warn you about</em>” he’s the guy to look out for! But you will never find a person so obviously devilish and geedy as O’Hare.\nThis movie tried to teach children that people like O’Hare are ones to look out for, knowing full well that they will never find that person, whilst portraying big CEO’s like the once-ler as chill goofy guys who didn’t mean to fuck up the earth, they have <strong>PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY</strong>.

The movie tries so hard to keep up this image that some amazing songs that both sound good and would have enhanced the overall plot of the movie, were probably cut because they portrayed the once-ler in a slightly negative tone.\nWhat ‘biggering’ eventually morphed into (how bad can I be) spits further in the face of any anti-corprate messages by being SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO BE CATCHY.

I think this is interesting because it shows the slightly differing ideology between each nation. Facist Italy was just that, facist, incredibly militaristic and nationalistic but nothing really special other than wanting to re-establish the roman empire.</p>\n<p>Then you have Nazi Germany who were driven by, you guesed it, Nazisim. This was basically Hitlers brand of facisim that focused on not only driving Germans forward but everyone else out. Finally you have Imperial Japan which I think is the most interesting, they were undoubtedly facist (millitaristic and nationalistic) but their conquest and motivation for war was much more focused on building an empire rather than just because they were facist, sure they (at least the leadership) thought they had a divine right to win and subjugate the rest of the world but that was more justification rather than motivation, the motivation was Imperialism.</p>\n<p>And I think thats the key point about these names, they represent each nations individual motivation, justification and overall just the driving factor behind each of their desire for war.

				"content_text": "THIS IS NOT AN ENDORSEMENT OF ANY IDEOLOGIES TALKED ABOUT IT IS MERELY A DISSCUSION ON THEM! \n\nWas thinking about this today, during WW2 the axis powers were not just refered to as all facist, you obviously had facist Italy and the other two definitely fell under thr umbrella of ‘facist’ but instead they are refered to as ‘Nazi Germany’ and ‘Imperial Japan’. I think this is interesting because it shows the slightly differing ideology between each nation. Facist Italy was just that, facist, incredibly militaristic and nationalistic but nothing really special other than wanting to re-establish the roman empire. \n\nThen you have Nazi Germany who were driven by, you guesed it, Nazisim. This was basically Hitlers brand of facisim that focused on not only driving Germans forward but everyone else out. Finally you have Imperial Japan which I think is the most interesting, they were undoubtedly facist (millitaristic and nationalistic) but their conquest and motivation for war was much more focused on building an empire rather than just because they were facist, sure they (at least the leadership) thought they had a divine right to win and subjugate the rest of the world but that was more justification rather than motivation, the motivation was Imperialism. \n\nAnd I think thats the key point about these names, they represent each nations individual motivation, justification and overall just the driving factor behind each of their desire for war.

First of all is that the defeat of the voice to parliament basically means that if a republic referendum was held right after and failed it would be a huge blow, 2 back to back rejections does not look good. I also found out that Australian Prime Ministers have no term limits like thr U.S does (also the U.S’s term limits only come from an ammendment, the 10th I believe). Just some random interesting facts to prove that learning dosent happen all at once and even small things can take days to begin to learn about.

After the queens death albanese stated that, out of respect, he would not push a republic referendum until at least his second term if it occurs. So it is entirely possible that in the next few years we will have a referendum on it. The only thing it would actually do is signify that Australia is no longer tied, in any way to the UK and we are fully independent. The president probably wouldn’t have any real power but be more of a person that is supposed to personify the nation and act as a diplomat. Personally I am 100% in favour of a republic and monarchys just seem like a relic from the past.
