It starts off really descriptive and detailed as the Author tries to prove that they can write like that and this isn’t going to be like any other story, it’s going to be detailed! The one caveat of this is that it often feels forced and a but ostentatious. After a few paragrpahs that Author seems to notice (or is forced to because of) that this style of writing is just not sustainable for them (and they do it poorly at that) and it eventually settles down into the real quality of the their writing. I think this is interesting because of how often I see it and how a few weeks ago before I noticed this it would he the exact kind of mistake that I would make. All it does is make you seem less competent, for example stories that don’t do this and kick off with the same style and quality feel so much better and interesting to read from the get go (this is also partly due to the fact that because they are not focusing on fancy writing they can actually write better and more engaging scenes).

It gets iffy after his corronation and theres this really long hit about him trying to get an heir that could have been spent on his Russian Campaign or any of the other battles. The 3rd act is really fast and obviously needed more time. They skip over basically everything after his kid (with the exception of the battle of Waterloo) and his later life is just not done justice. It feels to me like it was intended to be a 3.5-4 hour movie but they were forced to cut it down to show in theaters. One thing that I think was done well but still could have done with more time was the Battle of Waterloo, it didn’t really talk about how important it was and if you haden’t heard about it before it was kinda out of the blue but I really liked it as a battle scene. Theres one bit where the English all form squares and shoot down thre circling French cavalry that for some reason I just LOVED (but also hated because the French were litterally just going in circles like wtf do something lol). Anyway it was a very accurate movie, looked and sounded as I would expect from this kind of movie and all it needed is a longer runtime to become one of the best movies of the year. Oh also before I forget the acting was amazing, especially Pheonix just captured everything about Napolean perfectly.</p>\n",

				"title": "The actual importance of the U.S’s bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki",
				"content_html": "<p>While researching U.S military spending I came across an article arguing that the common narrative that Japan only surrendered because of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is not entirely accurate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/\">Article Link</a></p>\n<p>It has some interesting points but it mainly boils down to 2 main things (I’ll explain them and then give my opinion).</p>\n<p>The first thing they mention is how it happened at a time where every other day, a Japanese city was being bombed. This caused Japan to see the nuking on Hiroshima (and 3 days later Nagasaki) as more or less just an upgraded and slightly more powerful attack, and therefore weren’t going to surrender just because something that was already going on had slightly changed.</p>\n<p>The second reason is the Soviet Unions plans to invade Japan from the north, combined with Britain and the U.S’s invasion from the south was looking to be increasingly devastating for Japan. The USSR has only recently declared war on Japan and had already proven that they could easily sweep into and take critical Japanese city’s.

				"content_text": "While researching U.S military spending I came across an article arguing that the common narrative that Japan only surrendered because of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is not entirely accurate. \n\n[Article Link](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/)\n\nIt has some interesting points but it mainly boils down to 2 main things (I’ll explain them and then give my opinion).\n\nThe first thing they mention is how it happened at a time where every other day, a Japanese city was being bombed. This caused Japan to see the nuking on Hiroshima (and 3 days later Nagasaki) as more or less just an upgraded and slightly more powerful attack, and therefore weren’t going to surrender just because something that was already going on had slightly changed.\n\nThe second reason is the Soviet Unions plans to invade Japan from the north, combined with Britain and the U.S’s invasion from the south was looking to be increasingly devastating for Japan. The USSR has only recently declared war on Japan and had already proven that they could easily sweep into and take critical Japanese city’s. For Japan, a joint Allied invasion from the north and south was un-winnable. \n\nOne of the reasons that people see the bombings as the final stroke is because the Japanese surrender came 6 days after the bombings and it seems easy to connect to two.
